- Return pair<feature,IMessage> to structure in time as an mvc
- Try something similar to C#'s INotifyPropertyChanged for observer-Subject
- IDisposable for files
- Implement lambdas (especially FeatureController)
- what happens if a lambda iterates a list and encounters a null value? use .filter and .
- remove getFeature from feature interface

- Feature should register itself on FeatureFactory (maybe alongside with the implementation part of the observer pattern)

- featurefactory should get initialized before first usage, maybe passed around

- maybe i dont need a hashmap if i initialize new instances of items and rooms in the feature factory

- dont forget to remove container classes (strategy pattern)

- how to limitate a user from navigating to rooms which arent adjacent,
  and interacting with items which dont exist in the room
  maybe have a list of adjacent rooms in every room and check those on moveaction

- fix exit action (command needs to have attribute) and exit without waiting for another command
- commandfactory and command controller

!!!!make parser better he should translate west east etc to a room

- how should i know between to rooms which is west if both can be gradually
